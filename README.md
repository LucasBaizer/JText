#JText
A Java-based SMTP/SMS gateway client.

##What is it?
It's a cross-platform Java-based application which runs within a terminal, such as Command Prompt on Windows or Bash on Mac OS X. JText allows you to be able to send texts to any cellular device from your own computer.

##How does it work?
JText sends SMTP messages to the target devices' carrier's SMS gateway. The gateway converts the SMTP message into an SMS message, which is then sent to the target device's phone by the gateway.

For JText to work, you must give the application the credentials and DNS/IP addresses for your preferred SMTP server and POP3 server. It uses the SMTP server for sending messages, and your POP3 server for receiving responses from cellular devices. JText caches all sent SMTP messages and received POP3 messages into a local file, and deletes them on the remote server, allowing for faster connections and clutterless inboxes. 

##How do I run it?
